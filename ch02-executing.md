# Executing

Crypto companies often fall short on delivery of their vision. The few that successfully chart out vision and successfully execute on it have something in common.

They simply:

1. Set a clear vision for their team and community
2. Define steps to take in the direction of the vision
3. Do the steps and share that with their community

And they do this ad infinitum.

As simple as that sounds, crypto teams tend to drop the ball on this more often than not. Why is this the case? It’s often perceived that following web2-esque methods may not work for web3, but trust me, some of the best teams in the space embrace winning methodologies and transform business output for the company.

## How to execute?

It’s important to set a coherent vision that people can get behind. My hunch is, given how fast crypto is moving, thinking too far into the future may be pointless. Your vision for your company should be far enough your community can aspire to get to and short enough that it feels like individual steps your team takes feel like they’re in the right direction. Your vision may change, your team may grow - continue to ship the same process ad infinitum.

## Your Core Action

Think about what that one action or metric that characterizes it all for your company and moves the needle for your business. It can be different things based on what layer of the stack you operate. Think of this as the pulse of your business.

For base layers, such as layer 1 and scaling solutions, it could be transactions.
For DeFi applications, it could be Total Value Locked (TVL).
For Wallets, it could active users.
For Infrastucture providers, it could be revenue.
For Service Companies, it could be profit/employee.

## 3 Year Vision

I recommend starting with a 3 year vision with your leadership team. What do you see 3 years into the future, write it down in the following template:

**On date, our company will have maybe X TVL/profit/users/partners.**

Be specific and visualize vividly what this looks like and feels like. Write that down too.

Why is this such a powerful exercise? There’s a couple of reasons why starting here is quite powerful. It helps you, your team and community with painting a picture for where you’re headed and opens doors for them if they want to join. This significantly increases the chances that this will become a reality. This also forms a basis for a workback plan.

Visualization is a hard exercise, and especially so in decentralized teams. However, allowing thoughts to run free allows you to really dream up a possible reality. Once you’ve aligned and locked in on what this vision is, keep it handy. 3 years in crypto is a lot of time, but sur

## 1 Year Plan

You can use the following template:

**On date, our company will have maybe X TVL/profit/users/partners.**

**We will measure the following x things to by accountably measuring growth week on week to get to our goal:**

1. Twitter AMAs - 10,000
2. Partners signed - 25

**Our company’s goals for the next 365 days:**

1. We will get to 50,000 Twitter followers.
2. We will close on 3 enterprise partnerships leading to 100,000 new users.

Try to ensure that you have few goals and few things that you measure. Less is more and allows your team to focus. Make sure your goals and what you measure are in service of the 3 Year Picture that you paint for yourself.

After an annual planning session, communicate to the whole team and your community.

## Quarterly Planning

Now we move into territory that more immediate and tactical. Here’s where you decide on rocks that your company takes on in the quarter. This exercise allows you to focus on what you’re doing so you don’t FOMO into biting off more than what you can chew. Make sure to assign one owner to each that will be accountable. Assign to each person not more than 3-4 rocks. It allows them to focus. It is ideal for these rocks to be clear and specific and mutually aligned based on the goal.

Here are a few examples of rocks:

1. Implement growth campaigns for growing swapping - Alice
2. Run Hackathon around ETH Global - Bob
3. Ship side event at Turkey - Carol

After a quarterly planning session, communicate to the whole team and your community.

## Weekly Check Ins

Now that you have your vision and rocks locked in, it’s key to make sure you’re taking steps toward the goal. Weekly is a good cadence as, there are about 10-12 check ins before the close of the 90 days. Your goal here is to ensure that you are tracking toward the vision and the rocks your core team has picked to achieve. As an example:

- Growth: How many users are being onboarded?
- Engagement: How many perform the core action action?
- Retention: How many come back to do the same over time?

Keep agendas tight by celebrating wins, check in on last week and clear next steps for this week.

## Meetings

Good meetings have an agenda. Start and end on time. Solicit participation from the people present and follow up with clear next steps. I will share templates for each.

You have 4 types of meetings:

1. Annual planning meeting - where are we headed?
2. Quarterly meeting - what did we do right? what are we doing next?
3. Weekly meeting - how are we tracking toward the goal?
4. 1:1 Meeting - how are you doing? let’s solve an issue
5. All Hands / Community Call

All other time is used to:

1. Align
2. Execute / Ship
3. Communicate

Use meetings and communication to the team and community to celebrate wins and point out things that might get in the way of accomplishing the vision.

## Leveraging Data

Data is key to ensure that you’re moving at the pace your organization needs. Take time to design and develop a dashboard that captures all the key performance indicators that help you track toward the goal. It is well worth it, if you know it opens doors. Dune and a few other tools are a great way to do this in the open for on-chain data. Make sure the data is accessible on all devices. Data will allow you to not fly blind.

## Writing

It is important to implement a very strong writing culture. Since most teams are fully remote, writing is the best way to communicate unambiguously. Share standard templates and make sure information is organized in a way that is easy to find.

## Processes

Document every single process in your company. Does this allows you to simplify and scale more easily. Eg: how to ship? how to choose a partner to work with?

The second step after you've documented and simplified is to make sure it is followed each time. In Amazon, it's a common saying: Blame the Process, Not the People.

This allows you two flexibilities, to step away as needed (less people dependence), quicker ramp up (more productivity).
