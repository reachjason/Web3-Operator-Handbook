# Grants

## Grants in crypto

Grants in the space are financial awards given to incentivize individuals, teams, or projects that contribute to the development and enhancement of a particular ecosystem or project. These grants can come from various sources, including blockchain foundations, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and other entities invested in the growth and success of the ecosystem. They are typically provided to support research, development, community building, education, and other initiatives that align with the project's objectives.

This chapter covers both a perspective of foundations that wish to set up grants as well as individuals and businesses that wish to apply for grants.

### Strategy behind grants

Grants given out as native token of the ecosystem serve the purpose of growing proportionally the token value either directly or indirectly.

It's important to understand this whether you are the grant funder or the grantee. We can take a look at this with examples

1. Grants toward use cases: Projects that expand the functionality and use cases in the ecosystem (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, dApps) directly increase the demand for the token, as it's often required for transactions, governance, or interaction with these applications.
2. Grants toward increasing adoption: Educational initiatives and improved developer tooling lower barriers to entry eg: through ramps, leading to more users and developers in the ecosystem, thereby increasing transaction volume and demand for the token.
3. Grants toward ecosystem growth: A rich ecosystem of interoperable projects and platforms creates a network effect, where the value of the entire system grows as more participants join and contribute. This interconnected growth can lead to increased token utility and demand.
4. Grants toward brand building: Successful projects and a strong community can elevate the reputation and trust in the ecosystem, attracting more users, developers, and investors, further enhancing the token's value.
5. Grants toward technical improvements: Initiatives that improve speed, reduce costs, and enhance scalability make the project more attractive for both existing and new use cases, potentially increasing the token's utility and value.
6. Grants toward security: Investments in security research and protocol upgrades enhance the trustworthiness of the ecosystem, making the token a safer asset for investment and savings.
7. Grants toward awareness: Events, hackathons, and marketing initiatives increase the visibility of the ecosystem, drawing in developers, traders and long-term investors alike.
8. Grants toward research: for ecosystems where the token confers governance rights, increased participation and the successful execution of community-led projects can enhance the perceived value of these governance rights. Research into and implementation of innovative token economic models (e.g., deflationary mechanisms, staking rewards) can directly influence the token's scarcity and reward structures, affecting its market value. Efforts to address environmental concerns and promote sustainable practices within the ecosystem can enhance its appeal to a broader audience, including socially conscious investors. Funding R&D aimed at ensuring the ecosystem's long-term viability can position the token as a more stable and promising long-term investment.
