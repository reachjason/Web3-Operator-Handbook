# Engineering

I strongly recommend reading the [Startup CTO Handbook](https://github.com/ZachGoldberg/Startup-CTO-Handbook).

The target audience for this section would be people in an engineering organization and technical contributors to a project.

Establish cadence and forum for:
1. Clarifying what you ship
2. Shipping
3. Saying that you've shipped

Try to make this an agency driven pull process, rather than one where you have to keep checking in.

### Have an Internal "How We Work?" Doc

Use this document as a way to answer all questions that span the breadth of engineering. Your goal should be to answer any questions that come up pre-emptively about your product and how you ship using this document. You can be opinionated and specific to cover templates, best practices and other things.

Things to cover:

- Guiding principles - eg: blame the process, integrity, do what it takes etc
- Why this matters?
- Engineering processes
- Organization Structure of the "Build" Organization with accountabilities
- Programming Languages
- How you version control
- Testing - everything that is needed
- Reading List / Onboarding Guides
- Standards for naming, data processing, security, backups
- Auth
- Managing keys
- Mobile responsiveness
- API - Rest, Graph
- Access to tools - communication, cloud and SaaS - what and why?
- Coding Standards - quality, message formats, linting
- How we communicate? Internal, external
- How we ship? Vision to product, people management, cadences
- How we meet?
- Engineering Boards
- Ticketing Playbook - Bugs / Ideas
- Measuring success
- Technical Debt
- Incident handling - Warroom, Root Cause Analysis (RCA), documentation
- Maintenance cycles
- CI/CD - shipping cadence
- DevOps
- Retrospectives
- Performance management
- Technical documentation (spec, dev docs, PRD)
- Numbers
- Leveraging Grants
- Resource management - core, contractor
- Shipping Remotely

### Aligning Contributors

You need alignment between:
1. What they can do? Skills, capacity, experience
2. Do they fit the culture and core values?
3. Do they understand what is needed? Accountability, understanding
4. Do they share the vision? Do they get it?
5. Do they want it?

When a person fits the above yard stick you'll win as at the engineering organization.
