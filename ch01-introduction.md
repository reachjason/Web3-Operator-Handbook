# Introduction

Know thyself.

This is a maxim that dates back to ancient Greece. The Oracle of Delphi was a religious sanctuary dedicated to the Greek god Apollo, where a priestess, known as the Pythia, delivered prophecies. The phrase "γνῶθι σεαυτόν" (gnōthi seauton), meaning "know thyself," was inscribed in the forecourt of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The maxim urges self-awareness and understanding of one's own nature, limitations, and potential. It was considered fundamental to personal wisdom and growth in Greek philosophy.

Somehow, time and again, we find ourselves in the same cycles committing similar mistakes to our predecessors in the same positions. We evolve when we learn from others and that is the first goal of this body of content. We together attempt to distill knowledge from successful web3 operators here so as to make sure no one has to reinvent the wheel.

Secondly, web3 has presented a sense of non-linearity for careers across the world. In democratising access to industry and capital, there are ample non-traditional success stories. With people training hard, and finding their footing in this evolving wild wild west. Through this body of content, we want to enable more high school students from villages across Indonesia to ship meaningful crypto products and offer level ground for people to start in crypto.

The book can be used well by people looking to break into crypto as well as founders, operators and investors in crypto that are looking to level up. You don't need to have a technical background in order to take action on this body of content.

For the sake of this book, here’s a couple of things I want to share as we begin:

- I use crypto, blockchain and web3 interchangeably where relevant.
- Founder or Operator are used in a common context to denote a person or team responsible for executing the day-to-day activities and strategies necessary to drive growth and achieve the objectives of the startup
- Some of the chapters assume that the product you’re building will involve a token.

**Crypto as a market is huge. With over 1T in market cap. Which falls in the same ball park as [Consumer Goods](https://companiesmarketcap.com/consumer-goods/largest-consumer-goods-companies-by-market-cap/) and [Telecommunications](https://companiesmarketcap.com/telecommunication/largest-telecommunication-companies-by-market-cap/)**

This tells us two things:

1. The industry is worth paying attention to on the outside
2. As operators building this industry we need to build something of substance

In a big way, this piece of work is targeted toward solving for the latter.

Regardless of where you are on your spectrum of knowledge in crypto, this guide has got you.

There is a parallel often drawn between the internet and web3. The internet is well seasoned. A popular video that shows a popular news show in 1994 ridiculing the internet called “What is the Internet Anyway?”, however, look at where we are now. It’s hard to talk about the magnitude of growth the internet has experienced.

Without further ado, it’s time to dive right in.
